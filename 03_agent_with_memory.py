"""
Exercise 3: Agent with Memory - Short-term Conversation Memory
==============================================================

Learning Objectives:
- Understand how agents can remember conversation history
- Learn about context windows and memory management
- See how memory improves user experience

This agent remembers your conversation within the session, making it feel
more natural and contextual.

"""
üéØ Try these conversation flows to test memory:

Flow 1 - Personal Information:
1. "Hi! My name is [your name] and I love [hobby]"
2. "What's the weather like today?" (different topic)
3. "What's my name again?" (should remember)
4. "What do I enjoy doing?" (should remember hobby)

Flow 2 - Building Context:
1. "I'm planning a trip to Japan"
2. "What's the currency there?"
3. "Should I visit in spring or fall?" (remembers you're going to Japan)
4. "Any food recommendations for my trip?" (still remembers the context)

Flow 3 - Problem Solving:
1. "I'm learning Python programming"
2. "What's a good first project?"
3. "How do I handle errors in Python?" (knows you're learning Python)
4. "Any good resources for someone like me?" (remembers you're a beginner)

üß† Key Concepts:
- add_history_to_context=True includes past messages in LLM context
- num_history_runs=5 limits memory to prevent context overflow
- session_id groups related conversations
- user_id identifies the specific user (for multi-user systems)
- Memory improves user experience but uses more tokens

‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations:
- Memory is temporary (lost when script ends)
- Limited to recent exchanges (5 in this example)
- Uses more tokens = higher API costs
- No long-term user preferences stored

üìù Next: In 04_persistent_memory.py, we'll add permanent memory with a database!
