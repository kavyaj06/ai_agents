"""
Exercise 1: Agent with Tools - Adding Web Search Capabilities
=============================================================

Learning Objectives:
- Understand how tools extend agent capabilities
- Learn about function calling and tool use
- See how agents can access real-time information

This agent can search the web using DuckDuckGo, making it much more powerful
than the basic conversational agent from Exercise 0.

"""
üéØ Try these prompts to see tool usage:
1. "What's the latest news about AI?"
2. "What's the weather like in Tokyo today?"
3. "Tell me about the latest SpaceX launch"
4. "What are the current stock prices for Tesla?"
5. "What happened in the world today?"

Compare with these prompts that won't trigger tools:
1. "Tell me a joke" (no search needed)
2. "Explain how photosynthesis works" (general knowledge)
3. "What's 5 + 5?" (simple calculation)

üß† Key Concepts:
- tools=[DuckDuckGoTools()] adds web search capability
- show_tool_calls=True lets you see when tools are used
- The agent automatically decides when to use tools
- Tools turn agents from chatbots into action-taking systems

üìù Next: In 02_custom_tools.py, we'll build our own custom tools!
